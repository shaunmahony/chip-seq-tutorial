# ChIP-seq tutorial for ECG 2019

This is heavily based on the Galaxy ChIP-seq tutorial written by Anton Nekrutenko (https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/chip/). That tutorial was inspired by efforts of [Mo Heydarian](https://galaxyproject.org/people/mo-heydarian/) and [Mallory Freeberg](https://github.com/malloryfreeberg). Tools highlighted here have been wrapped by [Björn Grüning](https://github.com/bgruening), [Marius van den Beek](https://github.com/mvdbeek) and other [IUC](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/) members. [Dave Bouvier](https://github.com/davebx) and [Martin Cech](https://github.com/martenson) helped fine tuning and deploying tools to Galaxy's public server.
